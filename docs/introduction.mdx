At **Belief and Reason**, we are devoted to equipping Christians and engaging seekers in their pursuit of truth through the complementary disciplines of apologetics and polemics. Our approach is firmly rooted in the authority of Sola Scriptura — Scripture alone as the ultimate standard of truth.

## Our Mission
* Our desire is to strengthen and train believers in _faith_, _knowledge_, _wisdom_, and **to develop a Christ like love for others despite evil done against us**.

* Our desire is to address the **questions and challenges** posed by differing worldviews.

* Our desire is to demonstrate **the compatibility of belief and reason**:
  * **Belief** is **the mental acceptance or conviction that something is true or real**. It is often based on _evidence, reasoning, or trust_ in a source of information. 
  * **Reason** is the _faculty of logical and analytical thinking_ that **seeks to evaluate evidence, form judgments, and arrive at conclusions**. 

:::important Our Starting assumption (Axiom)

**Truth cannot be understood apart from the guidance of the Holy Spirit through God's Word as revealed in and by Jesus Christ**. 

Furthermore, it is our position that God uses our beliefs and reasoning faculties to lead individuals to saving faith in:

**Yeshua HaMashiach (יֵשׁוּעַ הַמָּשִׁיחַ)**, which is Hebrew for "Jesus the Messiah" or "Jesus the Anointed One."

### For Christians
This resource provides a strong foundation for understanding and defending the faith (apologetics) while equipping you with the tools to thoughtfully and respectfully challenge opposing ideas (polemics). Our perspectives are firmly rooted in Scripture, the divinely inspired and infallible guide to truth. Through careful exegesis, evidence-based reasoning, and historical analysis, we aim to prepare you to confidently share the hope of the Gospel and engage in meaningful dialogue to advance Christ’s kingdom and overcome the ruler of this world through Him.

### For seekers from all backgrounds
Whether you come from a different faith tradition, are skeptical, or are simply curious, Belief and Reason provides forum to explore challenging questions. Here, you’ll find thoughtful responses to objections, honest critiques of competing worldviews (which will be life changing), and an invitation to consider how the Bible reveals answers to life’s most profound questions found in the Jewish Messiah alone.

## Our Prayer and Hope

### Heavenly Father
We come before You with a heart open to Your boundless love and mercy. You are the source of all goodness, the light that overcomes all darkness, and the guide for every soul seeking truth. We lift up to You our friends, our enemies, and all who wander far from You.

### For Friends
Lord, We thank You for the gift of friendship. For the people who lift us up, challenge us, and walk with us through the joys and trials of life, We are deeply grateful. Bless them abundantly, Lord, with Your peace, Your provision, and Your presence. May their lives overflow with Your love, and may they always find their strength in You. Help us to be faithful friends, who love as You love and to serve as You have served.

### For Enemies
Father, You call us to love even those who oppose us. We lift up to You those who have hurt us, misunderstood us, or sought our harm. **Bless them, Lord**, with Your grace and lead them closer to Your truth. Heal the wounds that divide us and soften hearts where bitterness has taken root. **Teach us to forgive as You forgive** and to see them through Your eyes of compassion. May Your love bring reconciliation and peace where there is conflict.

### For the Wandering Soul
Lord of mercy, You are the Good Shepherd **who seeks the lost and calls them by name**. We pray for all who have drifted away from Your embrace, whether through doubt, fear, or the distractions of this world. Touch their hearts with Your gentle love and awaken in them a longing to return to You. Let them know that **Your arms are always open**, that **Your mercy is never-ending**, and that **no sin is too great for Your forgiveness**. May they find rest, renewal, and redemption in You, their loving Father.

### For Us All
Father, unite us in Your truth (Christ) and fill our hearts with Your Spirit. Forgive us for our crimes against you and each other. Teach us to walk humbly, to love unconditionally, and to live in a way that reflects Your glory. In Your presence, may we all find our home and rest in the promise of eternal life through your Son and the adoption as sons and daughters into your kingdom.

We ask this in the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever.

Amen.
