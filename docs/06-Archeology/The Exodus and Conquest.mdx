### **Explanation of Evidence Types**:
- **Burnt layers**: Indicates fire destruction of a city, a key feature in the biblical accounts of conquest.
- **Fortification destruction**: Involves the collapse or destruction of city walls, which aligns with the military conquests described in Joshua.
- **Altar structures**: Evidence of Israelite religious practices, including the building of altars in line with biblical descriptions.
- **Evidence of peaceful occupation**: Indicates that the Israelites settled in the land peacefully without destruction of certain cities, aligning with the biblical account of Israel taking possession of the land.

### **Supporting the Early Date (1446 BC)**
As seen in the table, discoveries like the **destruction of Jericho, Ai, and Hazor**, the **Israelite settlement at Shechem**, and the **altar at Mount Ebal** all point to a **destruction pattern** that aligns with an **early date (1446 BC)** for the Exodus and Joshua's conquest around **1406 BC**.

### **Key Points in the Timeline**:
1. **Jericho** – The **collapse of walls and destruction** fits with the biblical account of the **Israelites’ conquest**. The timing around **1400 BC** is consistent with **Joshua’s conquest**.
2. **Ai** – The **burning and abandonment** of Ai supports the biblical description of the city's **destruction** after Israel's victory.
3. **Hazor** – The **burnt city layers and smashed idols** suggest the **destruction** by a conquering force, possibly the **Israelites** as recorded in the **Bible**.
4. **Shechem** – The **peaceful settlement** without destruction is also consistent with **biblical events** in Joshua’s time.
5. **Mount Ebal** – The **altar on Mount Ebal** further supports the notion of **Israelite religious practices** beginning after the conquest.

### **Additional Notes**:
- **Amarna Letters**: The references to the **“Hapiru”** are significant. Some scholars connect these **“Hapiru”** with the **Hebrews**, describing the growing influence and presence of a **new people** in Canaan during the 14th century BC.
- **Post-Conquest Discoveries**: Inscriptions such as the **Merneptah Stele** and **Tel Dan Inscription** are relevant **post-conquest** and provide evidence for the **existence of Israel** in Canaan, but they do not directly support the Exodus itself. However, they reinforce the historical context for the Israelite presence.

---

### **Summary**:
The **archaeological discoveries** listed here offer significant support for the **early Exodus date (1446 BC)** and **Joshua’s conquest (~1406 BC)**. The **destruction of Jericho, Ai, and Hazor**, the **peaceful settlement at Shechem**, and the **altar at Mount Ebal** all correspond with the **biblical timeline** and point to a **unified historical context**. The inclusion of **Amarna Letters** further corroborates the timeline by referencing the **Hapiru**—a possible link to the **Israelites**.

This synchronization of **archaeology, biblical references, and astronomical evidence** makes a compelling case for the **historical reliability of the Exodus narrative** and the **conquest of Canaan**.
