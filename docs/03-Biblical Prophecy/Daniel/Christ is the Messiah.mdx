**Scholarly Analysis of Daniel 9:24-27 and Its Interpretations**

## Introduction
Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most debated passages in biblical prophecy. It provides a timeline concerning the coming of the Messiah, His atoning work, and the destruction of Jerusalem. Various interpretive frameworks have emerged, including Liberal (historical-critical), Traditional (Messianic-historical), Dispensational (Futurist), and Symbolic (Theological-allegorical). This article will examine these views, comparing them against biblical, astronomical, archaeological, and historical data to determine the best-fitting interpretation.

## **Text of Daniel 9:24-27 (ESV)**

>Daniel 9:24-27, **ESV**
>
>**Seventy weeks** are decreed about **your people** and your **holy city**, to **finish the transgression**, to put **an end to sin**, and to **atone for iniquity**, to bring in **everlasting righteousness**, to **seal both vision and prophet**, and to **anoint a most holy place.**
>
> Know therefore and understand that **from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem** to **the coming of an anointed one**, **a prince**, there **shall be seven weeks**. Then for **sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time.**
>
> And after the sixty-two weeks, **an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. And **the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.** **Its end shall come with a flood**, and **to the end** there **shall be war**. Desolations are decreed.
>
> And **he** shall make **a strong covenant with many for one week**, and for **half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering.** And on **the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate**, until the **decreed end** is poured out on **the desolator**.

## **Interpretations of Daniel 9:24-27**

| **Aspect**           | **Liberal (Montgomery)** | **Traditional (Pusey)** | **Dispensational (Seiss)** | **Symbolical (Leupold)** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **General View**     | Maccabean fulfillment with Antiochus IV Epiphanes | Christ‚Äôs first coming, His crucifixion, and destruction of Jerusalem | Christ‚Äôs first coming with a future 70th week (Tribulation) | Spiritual fulfillment, not tied to exact history |
| **Messiah‚Äôs Arrival** | Onias III, a high priest | Jesus Christ around AD 27-33 | Jesus after 69 weeks, 70th week delayed | Jesus spiritually, not an exact year |
| **Destruction of Temple** | Antiochus IV, 167 BC | Titus, AD 70 | Titus in AD 70, but future Antichrist destruction possible | Symbolic, tied to rejection of God |
| **Gap Between 69th & 70th Week?** | No gap, all past | No gap, continuous | Yes, gap before Tribulation | No gap, symbolic |
| **Best Fit for Biblical, Astronomical, and Historical Data?** | ‚ùå Weak | ‚úÖ **Strongest** | üî∂ Moderate | üî∂ Moderate |

### **Why the Traditional View Best Fits** ‚úÖ
1. **Biblical Alignment**
   - **Messiah's cutting off (Dan. 9:26)** perfectly aligns with Jesus' crucifixion.
   - **Destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70)** fits prophecy accurately.

2. **Historical & Astronomical Evidence**
   - **Decree in 457 BC (Artaxerxes I)** aligns with **483 years to AD 27**, marking the timeframe of John the Baptist‚Äôs ministry.
   - Jesus‚Äô public ministry **began in Fall AD 29** and lasted **3.5 years**, leading to **His crucifixion in AD 33**.
   - **Passover in AD 33 had a High Sabbath (John 19:31, ESV)**, fulfilling prophecy precisely.
   - **Phlegon of Tralles** records a great **darkness and an earthquake** in AD 33.
   - **A lunar eclipse (blood moon) on April 3, AD 33** aligns with Peter‚Äôs reference to Joel 2:31 (Acts 2:20, ESV).

## **Corrected Timeline of Events Leading to AD 33**
| **Event**              | **Year (AD)** | **Details** |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Decree to Rebuild Jerusalem (Artaxerxes I)** | **457 BC** | Starting point for Daniel‚Äôs 70 weeks prophecy. |
| **End of 69 Weeks (483 years later)** | **AD 27** | Marks the time of John the Baptist‚Äôs ministry (Luke 3:1-3, ESV). |
| **John the Baptist Begins Ministry** | **AD 27** | Prepares the way for Jesus. |
| **Jesus' Baptism** | **Fall AD 29** | Signifying the start of His 3.5-year ministry. |

## **Astronomical Events Supporting AD 33**
### **1. Blood Moon (Lunar Eclipse - April 3, AD 33)**
- Recorded in NASA‚Äôs eclipse database.
- Mentioned by **Phlegon of Tralles**, who noted an unusual darkening.
- **Acts 2:20 & Joel 2:31** reference the ‚Äúmoon turning to blood‚Äù (**ESV**).

### **2. Darkness at Crucifixion**
- **Matthew 27:45** states a mysterious darkness covered the land (**ESV**).
- Phlegon reports, ‚Äúin the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (AD 33), there was the greatest eclipse of the sun... and it became night at the sixth hour of the day.‚Äù
- Likely a supernatural event, as Passover occurs during a **full moon**, making a solar eclipse naturally impossible.

## **Conclusion**
The **Traditional (Pusey) interpretation** provides the most accurate alignment of **biblical prophecy, historical events, astronomical evidence, and archaeological findings**.

‚úÖ **AD 33 as the year of Jesus' crucifixion is the strongest fit because:**
1. **Daniel‚Äôs 70 Weeks calculation (457 BC ‚Üí AD 27 for John, crucifixion in AD 33).**
2. **The High Sabbath (Passover & Weekly Sabbath overlap) fits John 19:31 (ESV).**
3. **Astronomical events (blood moon, darkness, High Sabbath) confirm historical records.**
4. **The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 precisely fulfills Daniel 9:26 (ESV).**

This analysis confirms that Daniel 9:24-27 is a remarkable prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ, underscoring the divine accuracy of biblical prophecy.
