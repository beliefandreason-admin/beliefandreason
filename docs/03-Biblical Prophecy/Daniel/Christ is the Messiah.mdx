## **The Text of Daniel 9:24-27 (ESV)**

>Daniel 9:24-27, **ESV**
>
>**Seventy weeks** are decreed about **your people** and your **holy city**, to **finish the transgression**, to put **an end to sin**, and to **atone for iniquity**, to bring in **everlasting righteousness**, to **seal both vision and prophet**, and to **anoint a most holy place.**

>
> And after the sixty-two weeks, **an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. And **the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.** **Its end shall come with a flood**, and **to the end** there **shall be war**. Desolations are decreed.
>
> And **he** shall make **a strong covenant with many for one week**, and for **half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering.** And on **the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate**, until the **decreed end** is poured out on **the desolator**.

## **Interpretations of Daniel 9:24-27**

| **Aspect**           | **Liberal (Montgomery)** | **Traditional (Pusey)** | **Dispensational (Seiss)** | **Symbolical (Leupold)** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **General View**     | Maccabean fulfillment with Antiochus IV Epiphanes | Christ‚Äôs first coming, His crucifixion, and destruction of Jerusalem | Christ‚Äôs first coming with a future 70th week (Tribulation) | Spiritual fulfillment, not tied to exact history |

## **Astronomical Events Supporting AD 33**

### Blood Moon (Lunar Eclipse - April 3, AD 33)

</Zoom>

- Recorded in NASA‚Äôs eclipse database.
- Can be found using software such as **Stellarium** (Set the location and date and time to Jerusalem, April 3, AD 33 8 PM)
- Mentioned by **Phlegon of Tralles**, who noted an unusual darkening.
- **Acts 2:20 & Joel 2:31** reference the ‚Äúmoon turning to blood‚Äù (**ESV**).

### Darkness at Crucifixion
- **Matthew 27:45** states a mysterious darkness covered the land (**ESV**).
- Phlegon of Tralles was a Greek historian and writer from the 2nd century. He incorrectly calls it an eclipse but reported: 
  >in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (AD 33), there was the greatest eclipse of the sun... **and it became night at the sixth hour of the day.**
- Most likely **a supernatural event**, as Passover occurs during a **full moon**, making a solar eclipse naturally **impossible**.

---

## **First Fruits**

April 5, AD 33, is one of the commonly proposed dates for the **resurrection of Jesus**, which aligns with the Jewish festival of **Firstfruits** in that year.

### What is Firstfruits?
- **Firstfruits (Reishit Katzir or Bikkurim)** was a Jewish festival that occurred **on the day after the Sabbath** following Passover.
- This was the day when **the first sheaf of the barley harvest** was presented to God **in the temple as a sign of gratitude and trust** that the **full harvest would come** (Leviticus 23:9‚Äì14).
- In Christian theology, **Jesus' resurrection is comfortably linked to Firstfruits**, based on:
  >1 Corinthians 15:20 (ESV)  
  >But now **Christ has been raised** from the dead, **the firstfruits** of those who have fallen asleep."*

### Was April 5, AD 33, the Date of Firstfruits?
- Many scholars, including astronomers and biblical historians, argue that Jesus was **crucified on Friday, April 3, AD 33 (Nisan 14)**.
- If this date is correct, then **Sunday, April 5, AD 33 (Nisan 16), would indeed be Firstfruits**.
- This aligns with the idea that Jesus, rising from the dead on **Sunday, April 5, AD 33**, fulfilled the symbolism of Firstfruits as **the first among those resurrected**.
- In the **Pharisaic tradition** (which later influenced Rabbinic Judaism), Firstfruits was **always on Nisan 16** (fixed).



## Old Testament Prophecies of the One Who Prepares the Way for Christ

Several Old Testament passages predict the coming of John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Christ:

>Isaiah 40:3-5 (ESV)
>
>**A voice cries**: 'In the **wilderness prepare the way of the Lord**; make straight in the desert a highway **for our God**. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. And the **glory of the Lord shall be revealed**, and **all flesh shall see it together**, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.'

**Fulfilled** in Matthew 3:1-3, where John the Baptist is identified as the voice preparing the way for Christ.

> Malachi 3:1 (ESV)
>
>Behold, **I send my messenger**, and **he will prepare the way before me**. And **the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple**; and the **messenger of the covenant in whom you delight**, behold, **he is coming**, says the Lord of hosts."

**Jesus** himself refers to this prophecy as **fulfilled** in Matthew 11:10, where He identifies John the Baptist as the messenger.

> Malachi 4:5-6 (ESV)
>
>Behold, **I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes**. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with **a decree of utter destruction**.

**Jesus explains** in Matthew 17:10-13 that **John the Baptist** came **in the spirit of Elijah**, **fulfilling** this prophecy.

>Psalm 118:26 (ESV)
>
>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We bless you from the house of the Lord.

**Quoted in John 12:13** during Jesus‚Äô **triumphal entry**, where **the people recognized Him as the Messiah.**

>Zechariah 13:1 (ESV)
>
>**On that day** there shall be **a fountain opened** for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, **to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness**."

This prophecy relates to **John‚Äôs call for repentance through baptism** in Luke 3:3.

## **Dual Fulfillment: Synchronizing the Traditional and Dispensational Views**
### **Biblical Pattern of Dual Fulfillment**
Throughout the Bible, many prophecies have **both near-term and far-term fulfillments**, often referred to as **types and antitypes**. This pattern allows for:
1. **A historical fulfillment in the immediate or near future.**
2. **A final, eschatological fulfillment in the end times.**

Some examples include:
- **Isaiah 7:14**‚ÄîA prophecy about a child being born, partially fulfilled in **Hezekiah‚Äôs time** but ultimately in **Jesus (Matthew 1:22-23).**
- **The Abomination of Desolation (Daniel 11:31, 12:11)**‚ÄîPartially fulfilled by **Antiochus IV Epiphanes (167 BC)**, but later referenced by **Jesus (Matthew 24:15)** as **yet to come.**
- **The Day of the Lord (Joel 2:28-32)**‚ÄîPeter **partially applies it to Pentecost (Acts 2:16-21),** but it also points to a future tribulation event.

### **Applying Dual Fulfillment to Daniel 9:24-27**
By using this approach, we can synchronize **Pusey‚Äôs Traditional view** and **Seiss‚Äôs Dispensational view**:

| **Aspect**                      | **First Fulfillment (Past - Traditional View)**        | **Second Fulfillment (Future - Dispensational View)** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Messiah‚Äôs Arrival**           | Jesus' baptism (AD 29)                          | Second Coming of Christ                         |
| **Messiah Cut Off (9:26)**      | Jesus' crucifixion (AD 33)                      | Rejection of Christ in the Tribulation          |
| **The People of the Prince**    | Romans under Titus (AD 70)                      | A future revived empire (Antichrist‚Äôs kingdom)  |
| **Destruction of the Temple**   | The Roman destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70)      | A future temple desecrated in the end times    |
| **Firm Covenant (9:27)**        | Jesus establishing the New Covenant (Luke 22:20) | Antichrist making a false covenant with Israel |
| **Midst of the Week (3.5 years)** | Jesus‚Äô ministry lasting 3.5 years (AD 29-33)    | Antichrist breaking the covenant after 3.5 years |
| **Sacrifice Ceases (9:27)**     | Jesus' atoning death ending the need for sacrifice | Future Antichrist stopping temple sacrifices  |
| **Abomination of Desolation**   | The Roman desecration of the Temple (AD 70)      | The Antichrist setting up an idol in the temple (2 Thess. 2:4) |
| **Completion of 70 Weeks**      | The Gospel going to the Gentiles (AD 34)         | Final redemption at the Second Coming          |


### **Key Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Resolves the Gap Issue:**
   - The **first half of the 70th week (3.5 years)** is fulfilled by **Jesus' ministry (AD 29-33).**
   - The **second half (3.5 years)** is the **Great Tribulation, which is still future.**

2. **Explains Jesus' Covenant & Antichrist‚Äôs Treaty:**
   - Jesus **fulfilled** Daniel 9:27 spiritually, but **Antichrist will ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù it in the future.**

3. **Harmonizes the Prophecy with Revelation:**
   - Revelation **describes a 3.5-year period of tribulation (Rev. 11:2, 12:6, 13:5),** matching the **second half of Daniel‚Äôs 70th week.**

---


## Conclusion
The **Traditional (Pusey) interpretation** provides the most accurate alignment of **biblical prophecy, historical events, astronomical evidence, and archaeological findings**. This information shows God's absolute sovereignty over his creation including time itself.

‚úÖ **AD 33 as the year of Jesus' crucifixion is the strongest fit because:**

1. **Daniel‚Äôs 70 Weeks calculation (457 BC ‚Üí AD 27 for John, crucifixion in AD 33).**
2. **The High Sabbath (Passover & Weekly Sabbath overlap) fits John 19:31 (ESV).**
3. **Astronomical events (blood moon, darkness, High Sabbath) confirm historical records.**
4. **The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 precisely fulfills Daniel 9:26 (ESV).**
5. **Resurrection day** _April 5, AD 33_ was the **feast of Firstfruits**. This aligns with Leviticus 23:9‚Äì14 and 1 Corinthians 15:20

### **Duel Fulfillment**
The **dual fulfillment approach** allows us to synchronize the **Traditional (Pusey) and Dispensational (Seiss) interpretations** by:

- **Recognizing Jesus' ministry as the first fulfillment.**
- **Allowing for a future tribulation that completes the prophecy.**

‚úÖ **Jesus' atonement fulfills Daniel 9:24-27 historically, while the Antichrist‚Äôs actions will echo these events in the final tribulation.**

This approach aligns with the **biblical pattern of shadows and types**, providing a balanced interpretation that **integrates both views without contradiction.**
