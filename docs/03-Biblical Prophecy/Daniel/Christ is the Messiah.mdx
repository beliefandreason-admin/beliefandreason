**Scholarly Analysis of Daniel 9:24-27 and Its Interpretations**

## Introduction
Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most debated passages in biblical prophecy. It provides a timeline concerning the coming of the Messiah, His atoning work, and the destruction of Jerusalem. Various interpretive frameworks have emerged, including Liberal (historical-critical), Traditional (Messianic-historical), Dispensational (Futurist), and Symbolic (Theological-allegorical). This article will examine these views, comparing them against biblical, astronomical, archaeological, and historical data to determine the best-fitting interpretation.

## **The Text of Daniel 9:24-27 (ESV)**

>Daniel 9:24-27, **ESV**
>
>**Seventy weeks** are decreed about **your people** and your **holy city**, to **finish the transgression**, to put **an end to sin**, and to **atone for iniquity**, to bring in **everlasting righteousness**, to **seal both vision and prophet**, and to **anoint a most holy place.**
>
> Know therefore and understand that **from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem** to **the coming of an anointed one**, **a prince**, there **shall be seven weeks**. Then for **sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time.**
>
> And after the sixty-two weeks, **an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. And **the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.** **Its end shall come with a flood**, and **to the end** there **shall be war**. Desolations are decreed.
>
> And **he** shall make **a strong covenant with many for one week**, and for **half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering.** And on **the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate**, until the **decreed end** is poured out on **the desolator**.

## **Interpretations of Daniel 9:24-27**

| **Aspect**           | **Liberal (Montgomery)** | **Traditional (Pusey)** | **Dispensational (Seiss)** | **Symbolical (Leupold)** |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **General View**     | Maccabean fulfillment with Antiochus IV Epiphanes | Christ‚Äôs first coming, His crucifixion, and destruction of Jerusalem | Christ‚Äôs first coming with a future 70th week (Tribulation) | Spiritual fulfillment, not tied to exact history |
| **Messiah‚Äôs Arrival** | Onias III, a high priest | Jesus Christ around AD 27-33 | Jesus after 69 weeks, 70th week delayed | Jesus spiritually, not an exact year |
| **Destruction of Temple** | Antiochus IV, 167 BC | Titus, AD 70 | Titus in AD 70, but future Antichrist destruction possible | Symbolic, tied to rejection of God |
| **Gap Between 69th & 70th Week?** | No gap, all past | No gap, continuous | Yes, gap before Tribulation | No gap, symbolic |
| **Best Fit for Biblical, Astronomical, and Historical Data?** | ‚ùå Weak | ‚úÖ **Strongest** | üî∂ Moderate | üî∂ Moderate |

   - **Destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70)** fits prophecy accurately.

2. **Historical & Astronomical Evidence** ‚úÖ
   - **Decree in 457 BC (Artaxerxes I)** aligns with **483 years to AD 27**, marking the timeframe of John the Baptist‚Äôs ministry.

### Blood Moon (Lunar Eclipse - April 3, AD 33)

- Recorded in NASA‚Äôs eclipse database.
- Can be found using software such as **Stellarium** (Set the location and date and time to Jerusalem, April 3, AD 33 8 PM)
- Mentioned by **Phlegon of Tralles**, who noted an unusual darkening.
- **Acts 2:20 & Joel 2:31** reference the ‚Äúmoon turning to blood‚Äù (**ESV**).

### Darkness at Crucifixion
- **Matthew 27:45** states a mysterious darkness covered the land (**ESV**).
- Phlegon of Tralles was a Greek historian and writer from the 2nd century. He incorrectly calls it an eclipse but reported: 
  >in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (AD 33), there was the greatest eclipse of the sun... **and it became night at the sixth hour of the day.**
- Most likely **a supernatural event**, as Passover occurs during a **full moon**, making a solar eclipse naturally **impossible**.

## **First Fruits**

April 5, AD 33, is one of the commonly proposed dates for the **resurrection of Jesus**, which aligns with the Jewish festival of **Firstfruits** in that year.

### What is Firstfruits?
- **Firstfruits (Reishit Katzir or Bikkurim)** was a Jewish festival that occurred **on the day after the Sabbath** following Passover.
- This was the day when **the first sheaf of the barley harvest** was presented to God **in the temple as a sign of gratitude and trust** that the **full harvest would come** (Leviticus 23:9‚Äì14).
- In Christian theology, **Jesus' resurrection is comfortably linked to Firstfruits**, based on:
  >1 Corinthians 15:20 (ESV)  
  >But now **Christ has been raised** from the dead, **the firstfruits** of those who have fallen asleep."*

### Was April 5, AD 33, the Date of Firstfruits?
- Many scholars, including astronomers and biblical historians, argue that Jesus was **crucified on Friday, April 3, AD 33 (Nisan 14)**.
- If this date is correct, then **Sunday, April 5, AD 33 (Nisan 16), would indeed be Firstfruits**.
- This aligns with the idea that Jesus, rising from the dead on **Sunday, April 5, AD 33**, fulfilled the symbolism of Firstfruits as **the first among those resurrected**.
- In the **Pharisaic tradition** (which later influenced Rabbinic Judaism), Firstfruits was **always on Nisan 16** (fixed).



## Old Testament Prophecies of the One Who Prepares the Way for Christ

Several Old Testament passages predict the coming of John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Christ:

>Isaiah 40:3-5 (ESV)
>
>**A voice cries**: 'In the **wilderness prepare the way of the Lord**; make straight in the desert a highway **for our God**. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. And the **glory of the Lord shall be revealed**, and **all flesh shall see it together**, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.'

**Fulfilled** in Matthew 3:1-3, where John the Baptist is identified as the voice preparing the way for Christ.

> Malachi 3:1 (ESV)
>
>Behold, **I send my messenger**, and **he will prepare the way before me**. And **the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple**; and the **messenger of the covenant in whom you delight**, behold, **he is coming**, says the Lord of hosts."

**Jesus** himself refers to this prophecy as **fulfilled** in Matthew 11:10, where He identifies John the Baptist as the messenger.

> Malachi 4:5-6 (ESV)
>
>Behold, **I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes**. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with **a decree of utter destruction**.

**Jesus explains** in Matthew 17:10-13 that **John the Baptist** came **in the spirit of Elijah**, **fulfilling** this prophecy.

>Psalm 118:26 (ESV)
>
>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We bless you from the house of the Lord.

**Quoted in John 12:13** during Jesus‚Äô **triumphal entry**, where **the people recognized Him as the Messiah.**

>Zechariah 13:1 (ESV)
>
>**On that day** there shall be **a fountain opened** for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, **to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness**."

This prophecy relates to **John‚Äôs call for repentance through baptism** in Luke 3:3.

## Conclusion
The **Traditional (Pusey) interpretation** provides the most accurate alignment of **biblical prophecy, historical events, astronomical evidence, and archaeological findings**. This information shows God's absolute sovereignty over his creation including time itself.

‚úÖ **AD 33 as the year of Jesus' crucifixion is the strongest fit because:**

1. **Daniel‚Äôs 70 Weeks calculation (457 BC ‚Üí AD 27 for John, crucifixion in AD 33).**
2. **The High Sabbath (Passover & Weekly Sabbath overlap) fits John 19:31 (ESV).**
3. **Astronomical events (blood moon, darkness, High Sabbath) confirm historical records.**
4. **The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 precisely fulfills Daniel 9:26 (ESV).**
5. **Resurrection day** _April 5, AD 33_ was the **feast of Firstfruits**. This aligns with Leviticus 23:9‚Äì14 and 1 Corinthians 15:20
