The **Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks** in **Daniel 9:24-27** is a remarkable prophecy that predicts the timing of **Jesus Christ’s birth, death, and resurrection** with astonishing accuracy. Here’s how:

---

### **1. The Prophecy’s Timeline (Daniel 9:24-27)**
The prophecy states that **seventy "weeks" (sevens)** are determined for Israel to fulfill God’s plan. These "weeks" represent **groups of seven years** (not days), meaning **70 weeks = 490 years**.

Gabriel breaks down the timeline into **three parts**:

- **7 weeks (49 years)** – The rebuilding of Jerusalem.
- **62 weeks (434 years)** – Leading up to the arrival of the Messiah.
- **1 final week (7 years)** – Future tribulation and covenant breaking.

### **2. The Start of the Prophetic Clock**
Daniel 9:25 states that the countdown begins with **a decree to rebuild Jerusalem**:

> "From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven 'weeks,' and sixty-two 'weeks.'"

This decree was issued by **Artaxerxes I in 445 B.C.** (Nehemiah 2:1-8), allowing the Jews to return and rebuild their city.

### **3. Predicting Christ’s Birth and Ministry**
- The prophecy predicts **69 weeks (7 + 62 weeks) = 483 years** from the decree to the coming of the Messiah.
- Using the **Jewish prophetic calendar (360-day years)**, 483 years from **445 B.C.** leads us to approximately **30 A.D.**, which aligns with the time of Jesus’ public ministry and triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Luke 19:28-40).

### **4. Predicting Christ’s Death**
Daniel 9:26 states:

> **"After the sixty-two 'weeks,' the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing."**  

- **"Anointed One" (Messiah)** refers to Jesus.
- **"Cut off"** refers to His crucifixion.
- This happened **AFTER** the 69th week, meaning sometime between 30-33 A.D.

This directly predicts **Jesus’ crucifixion**, which happened around **30-33 A.D.**, fulfilling the prophecy perfectly.

### **5. Predicting Christ’s Resurrection and the Gospel Era**
Daniel 9:24 says that the **seventy weeks will bring:**
- "An end to sin."
- "Atonement for iniquity."
- "Everlasting righteousness."

These were fulfilled in **Jesus' death and resurrection**:
- **His death** atoned for sins.
- **His resurrection** confirmed His victory over sin and death.
- The Gospel of righteousness was preached to all nations.

### **6. The Destruction of Jerusalem (70 A.D.)**
Daniel 9:26 also states:

> **"The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary."**

- This was fulfilled in **70 A.D.** when the **Romans** destroyed Jerusalem and the **Second Temple**, as Jesus also prophesied (Matthew 24:2).

### **Conclusion: The Prophecy’s Fulfillment in Jesus**
1. **Christ’s Birth**: The prophecy pinpoints the exact timeframe for the arrival of the Messiah.
2. **Christ’s Death**: It predicts the Messiah’s rejection and being "cut off" (crucified).
3. **Christ’s Resurrection**: It foretells atonement for sin and bringing righteousness.

This prophecy is one of the strongest Old Testament confirmations of **Jesus as the Messiah**! Would you like a chart showing this timeline visually?
