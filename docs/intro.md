# Welcome to Belief and Reason: A Resource for Truth-Seekers

At **Belief and Reason**, we are devoted to equipping Christians and engaging seekers in their pursuit of truth through the complementary disciplines of apologetics and polemics. Our approach is firmly rooted in the authority of Sola Scriptura — Scripture alone as the ultimate standard of truth.

## Our Mission
* To strengthen and train believers in faith, knowledge, wisdom, and love for others.

* To address the questions and challenges posed by differing worldviews.

* To demonstrate the harmony of belief and reason:
  * **Belief** is the mental acceptance or conviction that something is true or real. It is often based on evidence, reasoning, or trust in a source of information. 
  * **Reason** The faculty of logical and analytical thinking that seeks to evaluate evidence, form judgments, and arrive at conclusions. 
  
Under the guidance of God’s Word, belief and reason leads humanity to a saving **faith** in the Messiah, Yeshua.

>**John 20:30-31**
>
>30 Now _Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples_, **which are not written in this book**; 
31 **but these are written** so that **you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God**, and that _by believing you may have life in his name_.

## For Christians
This resource provides a strong foundation for understanding and defending the faith (apologetics) while equipping you with the tools to thoughtfully and respectfully challenge opposing ideas (polemics). Our perspectives are firmly rooted in Scripture, the divinely inspired and infallible guide to truth. Through careful exegesis, evidence-based reasoning, and historical analysis, we aim to prepare you to confidently share the hope of the Gospel and engage in meaningful dialogue to advance Christ’s kingdom and overcome the ruler of this world through Him.

## For seekers from all backgrounds
Whether you come from a different faith tradition, are skeptical, or are simply curious, Belief and Reason provides a loving space to explore challenging questions. Here, you’ll find thoughtful responses to objections, honest critiques of competing worldviews (which will be life changing), and an invitation to consider how the Bible reveals timeless answers to life’s most profound questions found in the Jewish Messiah (Yeshua) alone.
