### Introduction

The gospel **begins with an understanding of God’s law**, which reflects **His perfect righteousness and moral character**. The law was given **to reveal sin** and to lead humanity to the realization of their need for a Savior. Jesus summarized the law in two great commandments:

| Commandment | Scripture |
|------------|-----------|
| Love God | "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." (Matthew 22:37-38) |
| Love Others | "And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." (Matthew 22:39-40) |

God’s law is holy, righteous, and good (Romans 7:12), yet it exposes our sinfulness, for no one can keep it perfectly (Romans 3:23). The conscience bears witness to this truth (Romans 2:15). The law was not given as a means of salvation but to lead us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). 

### Analogy: The Mirror of the Law
The **law can be compared to a mirror**. A mirror shows us our physical imperfections, but **it cannot cleanse us**. Likewise, the law reveals our sin but cannot save us:

| Function | Scripture |
|---------|-----------|
| Reveals Sin | "For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin." (Romans 3:20) |
| Brings Conviction | "For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it." (James 2:10) |
| Leads to Christ | "So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith." (Galatians 3:24) |

Thus, the law convicts but does not save. It reveals that all have sinned and fallen short (Romans 3:23), bringing the just penalty of death (Ezekiel 18:4, Romans 6:23). Only through Christ can the righteous requirement of the law be fulfilled (Romans 8:3-4), for love was fully demonstrated at the cross (Romans 5:8).

### The Fulfillment of Love
Through Christ, the perfect love of God was demonstrated:

| Fulfillment | Scripture |
|------------|-----------|
| Christ’s Love | "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8) |
| Righteousness by Faith | "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes." (Romans 10:4) |

Love is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10), but humanity, in its fallen state, is incapable of fulfilling it. Jesus alone has perfectly kept the law and offers His righteousness to those who believe in Him.
