### Introduction

The central **paradox of the gospel** is how God can be **both perfectly just and infinitely loving**. His justice **demands that sin be punished** (Ezekiel 18:4, Romans 6:23), yet His **love desires to save sinners** (John 3:16). The **cross is where these two attributes meet in perfect harmony**.

### The Demand of Justice
God’s righteousness requires that sin be judged. **He cannot overlook evil without violating His own holy nature.**

| Principle | Scripture |
|-----------|-----------|
| Sin’s Consequence | "The soul who sins shall die." (Ezekiel 18:4) |
| The Wages of Sin | "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23) |
| The Law’s Verdict | "For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin." (Romans 3:20) |

If God were only just, humanity would be without hope, for no one can meet His perfect standard (Romans 3:23). But God is also love.

### The Depth of God’s Love
In His mercy, God provided a way of salvation through Jesus Christ.

| Expression of Love | Scripture |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Christ’s Sacrifice | "But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8) |
| God’s Gift of Salvation | "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) |
| Jesus, the Substitute | "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." (2 Corinthians 5:21) |

### The Cross: Where Love and Justice Meet
God’s **justice was fully satisfied at the cross**. Jesus bore **the penalty of sin**, demonstrating both _His holiness and His mercy_.

| Aspect | Scripture |
|--------|-----------|
| Justice Satisfied | "Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him; he has put him to grief." (Isaiah 53:10) |
| Atonement for Sin | "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us." (Galatians 3:13) |
| Just and Justifier | "So that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus." (Romans 3:26) |

### Faith: The Key to Reconciliation
Salvation is **not earned by works** but received **by faith**.

| Means of Salvation | Scripture |
|------------------|-----------|
| Justification by Faith | "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." (Romans 5:1) |
| Grace, Not Works | "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9) |
| No Condemnation | "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." (Romans 8:1) |

### Conclusion

Through Christ and Christ alone, **God remains just while offering salvation to all who believe**. The **paradox of love and justice** is solved at the **cross**, where **Jesus bore sin’s penalty and opened the way to eternal life**.

> John 14:6  
6 Jesus said to him, “**I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me**.

> John 10:9
9 **I am the door**. If anyone enters **by me**, he **will be saved** and will go in and out and find pasture.

If the cross alone was the way that God solved the need for justice and love, then **by what other method can you get to God**?
