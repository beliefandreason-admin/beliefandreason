**The Law Cannot Save Us**

The law of God is holy, righteous, and good (Romans 7:12), but it was never intended to be a means of salvation. Rather, it serves to reveal sin and our need for a Savior.

### The Purpose of the Law
The law acts as a mirror, showing us our sinful nature but offering no power to save.

| Purpose | Scripture |
|---------|-----------|
| Reveals Sin | "For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin." (Romans 3:20) |
| Brings Awareness of Sin | "I would not have known what sin was except through the law." (Romans 7:7) |
| Declares Guilt | "For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it." (James 2:10) |

### The Law Condemns but Cannot Save
The law brings condemnation because it demands perfect obedience, which no one can achieve.

| The Lawâ€™s Verdict | Scripture |
|------------------|-----------|
| The Wages of Sin | "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23) |
| The Curse of the Law | "For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.'" (Galatians 3:10) |
| No Justification by the Law | "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ." (Galatians 2:16) |

### Salvation Comes Through Faith in Christ
Since no one can be justified by the law, salvation must come through faith in Jesus Christ.

| Salvation by Faith | Scripture |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Justified by Faith | "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." (Romans 5:1) |
| The Law Leads to Christ | "So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith." (Galatians 3:24) |
| Righteousness Apart from the Law | "But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law... the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe." (Romans 3:21-22) |

### Conclusion
The law exposes our sin and points us to Christ, but it cannot save us. Only through faith in Jesus can we be justified and receive eternal life. "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes." (Romans 10:4)
