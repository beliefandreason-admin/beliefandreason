- The **Old Testament** contains **39 books**, written between **1500 and 400 BC**.

### Languages of the Bible

The **Old Testament** was primarily written in **Hebrew**, with portions in **Aramaic**.
The **New Testament** was written in **Koine Greek**, the common language of the time.

The canonization of the Old and New Testaments was a gradual process influenced by historical, religious, and cultural developments. Below is an explanation followed by a table summarizing key dates and events.

### Canonization of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible)

The Old Testament canon developed over centuries, as Jewish communities recognized certain writings as divinely inspired and authoritative. The process involved three main stages:

1. **Torah (Pentateuch) Canonization (c. 400 BC)**  
   - The first five books (Genesis–Deuteronomy) were widely accepted as authoritative by Jewish leaders after the Babylonian exile.
   
2. **Prophets Canonization (c. 200 BC)**  
   - The books of the Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 12 minor prophets) gained formal recognition as Scripture.

3. **Writings Canonization (c. AD 90)**  
   - The final section, including Psalms, Proverbs, and historical books, was affirmed at the Council of Jamnia (AD 90), though most were already widely accepted before this.

The Greek **Septuagint (LXX)** (c. 250–150 BC) was an early translation of Hebrew Scriptures, including additional books (Apocrypha), later debated by Jews and Christians.

### **Canonization of the New Testament**
The New Testament canon emerged as the early church recognized writings that aligned with apostolic teaching. Factors influencing recognition included:

1. **Apostolic Authorship** – Written by apostles or their close associates.  
2. **Doctrinal Consistency** – Aligned with established Christian beliefs.  
3. **Widespread Use** – Accepted and used in early Christian worship.  

Key moments in the New Testament canonization:

- **End of 1st Century (c. AD 100):** Most churches accepted the four Gospels and Paul’s letters.  
- **Early 2nd Century (c. AD 150-200):** Early church fathers (e.g., Irenaeus) referenced authoritative books.  
- **Late 2nd Century (c. AD 200-300):** The Muratorian Fragment (c. AD 170) listed 22 of the 27 books.  
- **4th Century Councils (AD 367-397):** The final New Testament canon was affirmed by church leaders.
