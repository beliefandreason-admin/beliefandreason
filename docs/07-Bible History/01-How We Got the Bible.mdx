### Introduction

The Bible consists of **66 books**, written over a span of **1,600 years** (approximately **1500 BC to AD 100**) by more than **40 authors**, including kings, prophets, leaders, and followers of Jesus.  

- The **Old Testament** contains **39 books**, written between **1500 and 400 BC**.  
- The **New Testament** consists of **27 books**, written between **AD 45 and 100**.  

The **Hebrew Bible** contains the same text as the Old Testament in the **English Bible** but is arranged and divided differently.  



### Languages of the Bible

- The **Old Testament** was primarily written in **Hebrew**, with portions in **Aramaic**.
- The **New Testament** was written in **Koine Greek**, the common language of the time.



### First Book on a Printing Press

The Bible was **the first book to ever be printed on the printing press** with moveable type. (Gutenberg Press, 1455,  Latin Bible)

### Has the Text Changed?

This topic will be explored in a later chapter. However, let us be clear: **the Bible we have today remains remarkably faithful to the original writings**. Of the thousands of handwritten copies produced before 1500, nearly 5,900 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament alone still exist. In fact, the Bible's text **is better preserved than any other ancient document**, surpassing even the works of **Plato and Aristotle**.

The discovery of the **Dead Sea Scrolls** confirmed the astonishing reliability of some of the copies of the Old Testament made over the years. Although some spelling variations exist, **no variation affects Biblical Doctrines**.

### Transmission

> Matthew 24:14
And this gospel of the kingdom will be **proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations**, and then the end will come.

The Bible was carried to many nations and translated into the common languages of the people by scholars eager to share Godâ€™s Word. Yet, even today, approximately **2,000 language groups** still **lack a Bible in their native tongue**.
