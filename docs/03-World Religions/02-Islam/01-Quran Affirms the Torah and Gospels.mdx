# The Quran’s Affirmation of the Torah and the Gospel

The Quran **consistently upholds the continuity of divine revelation**, affirming that **it does not introduce a new message** but rather **confirms previous scriptures**, particularly the **Torah (Tawrah) and the Gospel (Injeel)**. It **acknowledges these earlier revelations** as part of the same divine guidance, urging **the People of the Book—Jews and Christians—to recognize the Quran as a continuation of God’s message. The Quran emphasizes that true belief **entails accepting all of God’s revelations** and warns against rejecting its message despite its alignment with previous scriptures. The following verses illustrate this confirmation, reinforcing the Quran’s role as both a validator and a final clarification of divine truth.

The following Quran Verses that **confirm and validate the previous scriptures**. These verses clearly display that the Torah and the Gospels **cannot have been corrupted** and that **Allah himself handed them down**.

Once **these are accepted as the words of Allah**, then we can find the **inconsistencies** between the Quran and the previous scriptures **to destroy the Quran**. If the Torah and Gospels are true (previous divine revelation) then if Mohammed comes on the scene and **attempts to contradict** them means **we do not have to listen to the Quran period**.



Q. 2:41
Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures. Do not be the first to deny them or trade them for a fleeting gain. And be mindful of Me.

Q. 2:89 
Although they used to pray for victory ˹by means of the Prophet˺ over the polytheists, when there came to them a Book from Allah which they recognized, confirming the Scripture they had ˹in their hands˺, they rejected it. So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers.

Q. 2:91 
When it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you are ˹truly˺ believers?”

Q. 2:97 
Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he revealed this ˹Quran˺ to your heart by Allah’s Will, confirming what came before it—a guide and good news for the believers.”


Q. 2:101 
Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.

Q. 3:3 
He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book in truth, confirming what came before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel

Q. 3:81 
˹Remember˺ when Allah made a covenant with the prophets, ˹saying,˺ “Now that I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger confirming what you have, you must believe in him and support him.” He added, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” Allah said, “Then bear witness, and I too am a Witness.”

Q. 4:47 
O you who were given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed—confirming your own Scriptures—before We wipe out ˹your˺ faces, turning them backwards, or We condemn the defiant as We did to the Sabbath-breakers. And Allah’s command is always executed!

Q. 5:48 
We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.

Q. 6:92 
This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came before it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities1 and everyone around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter ˹truly˺ believe in it and guard their prayers.

Q. 10:37 
It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds.

Q. 12:111 
In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather ˹it is˺ a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.
