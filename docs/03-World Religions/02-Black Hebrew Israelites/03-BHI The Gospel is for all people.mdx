# The Gospel is for All People


### BHI Claim: 

Salvation is **only for Israelites**.

### Bible Refutation:

> Galatians 3:28-29   
There is **neither** Jew nor Greek, \
there is **neither** bond nor free, \
there is **neither** male nor female: \
for **ye are all one in Christ Jesus**.  
And **if ye be Christ’s**,  
then are **ye Abraham’s seed**, 
and **heirs according to the promise**.

This passage clearly states that **salvation is available to all, not just Israelites**.

> Romans 10:12-13 \
For there is **no difference** between the **Jew and the Greek**: \
for the same Lord over all **is rich unto all that call upon him**.   
For **whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved**.

Paul **explicitly states** that there **is no distinction between Jews and Gentiles** under Christ in Salvation.

> Matthew 28:19   
Go ye therefore, and **teach all nations**, 
baptizing them in the name of **the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost**.

**Jesus** commands His disciples to **preach the Gospel to "all nations," not just Israelites**.
