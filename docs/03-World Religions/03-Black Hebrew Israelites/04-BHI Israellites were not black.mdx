# Israel Was Not Black Exclusively

### BHI Claim: 

The ancient Israelites were black, and modern Jews are imposters.

### Bible Refutation:

> Lamentations 4:7-8  
Her princes were purer than snow,  
whiter than milk;  
their bodies were more ruddy than coral,  
the beauty of their form was like sapphire. 
>
> Now their face is blacker than soot;
they are not recognized in the streets;
their skin has shriveled on their bones;
it has become as dry as wood.

#### Context:

Lamentations describes the dramatic downfall of Jerusalem’s nobles during the Babylonian siege, emphasizing their former glory and beauty before their tragic decline. 

#### Verse 7 
Describes the past glory of Jerusalem’s nobility (possibly Nazarites or devoted individuals). They were pure, healthy, and radiant in appearance, likened to whiteness and precious gems.

#### Verse 8 
Starkly contrasts this, showing their present state **due to starvation and suffering**. Their once-glowing complexion has turned dark (possibly from malnutrition and distress), and **their bodies have wasted away to the point of being unrecognizable**.

This passage is a lament over the tragic consequences of **sin** and a stark reminder of **how far Judah had fallen under divine judgment**.

This passage describes Israelites as being "ruddy" (a reddish complexion), which **is not a trait exclusive to black people**.

#### In Samuel we have a **description of King David**.

> 1 Samuel 16:12  
And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. 

Again, the term "ruddy" means **a light-skinned, reddish complexion**.

#### When Moses was mistaken for an Egyptian:

> Exodus 2:19  
They said, “An **Egyptian** delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and even drew water for us and watered the flock.”

Egyptians at that time were a **mix of brown-skinned North Africans**, not necessarily black Africans. **If Moses looked like an Egyptian, he was not black**.
