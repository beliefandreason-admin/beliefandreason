Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) use a variety of Bible translations, but their preferred versions often depend on the specific camp or sect they belong to. Some of the most commonly used texts and translations include the following.

### King James Version (KJV)

#### Why They Use It:

Many BHI groups believe the KJV is the **most authoritative** and **least corrupted** English translation of the Bible. They often **reject modern translations**, claiming they have been tampered with by European scholars.

#### How They Use It: 

They frequently **cite verses from the KJV but often misinterpret or take them out of context** to fit their **racialized** theology.

### Apocrypha (Deuterocanonical: Second Canon Books)

#### Why They Use It:

Many BHI groups accept the Apocrypha (books like 2 Esdras, Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, etc.), which were included in older versions of the KJV and Catholic Bibles.

#### How They Use It 
They often use 2 Esdras 6:54-59 to argue that Israelites are superior to other nations.

Scholars generally date this book to the late 1st century AD, likely between 70–135 AD.
It is **not part of the Hebrew Bible** though was included in some Christian traditions.

### The "Hebrew-Israelite" Translations

Some BHI camps use **their own modified translations**, such as:
- The **Cepher** Bible:  
This version includes the Apocrypha and extra-biblical books like the Book of Enoch and Jubilees.
- The **ISR** (Institute for Scripture Research) Translation:  
A Hebrew Roots Bible that removes English names like “Jesus” and replaces them with **Yahusha** or **Yahawashi** (depending on their pronunciation preference).

### **4. New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) or Other Translations**

   - Some BHI groups **use other translations when convenient**, but they generally stick to older versions like the **KJV** or **Cepher**.

### **Common Issues with Their Bible Interpretation**

- **Out-of-Context** Proof Texting:  
They **isolate verses** to push their doctrine **while ignoring the full biblical message**.
- **Eisegesis** Instead of **Exegesis**:  
**Instead of drawing meaning from the text**, they **impose** their **racial** and nationalistic views **onto the Scriptures**.
- **Mistranslations** and **Made-Up Hebrew**:  
Some camps insist on names like **Yahawashi** (instead of **Yeshua** or **Jesus**) without **real linguistic** support.

### **Conclusion**

Most Black Hebrew Israelite groups primarily use the **KJV** and the **Apocrypha**, often supplemented with their own Hebrew-influenced versions. 

However, **their primary issue is not which Bible they use**, but **how they misinterpret and manipulate the text** to fit their ideology.

In the following sections you will see how they **manipulate** the text to suit their **theology**.
