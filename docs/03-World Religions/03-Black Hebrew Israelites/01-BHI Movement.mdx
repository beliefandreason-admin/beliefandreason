# Introduction: Countering Black Hebrew Israelite Theology  

In recent years, the **Black Hebrew Israelite (BHI)** movement has gained traction, spreading a variety of theological claims that challenge traditional Christian beliefs. While the movement is diverseâ€”ranging from __peaceful religious groups__ to more __radical factions__ many of **its core doctrines distort biblical teachings**, promote **ethnocentric interpretations** of Scripture, and **reject essential Christian doctrines** such as **salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ**.  

This section aims to provide a biblical and historical response to Black Hebrew Israelite theology, addressing key issues such as their claims of **exclusive Israelite identity**, their views on **the law and salvation**, and their **rejection of the gospel message as understood in historic Christianity**. 

The goal of these documents **are not to attack individuals** but to rebuke and correct using truth-seeking dialogue rooted in sound **exegesis**, **historical evidence**, and the **love of Christ** so that **all** will kneel at **His** feet.  

In 1 Peter 3:15 we read,

>"always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have, but do this with gentleness and respect." 

With Paul's words in mind, lets examine the claims of the BHI movement.
