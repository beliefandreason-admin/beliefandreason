# Gen 1:26, 28 Dominion

![Lion and Lamb](./lion-lamb.png)

> Genesis 1:26, 28 \
> Let man have dominion... over all the Earth

## Fulfilled in part, yet not perfect

The dominion mandate was fulfilled in part, but not perfectly in Adam, due to the sinfulness of man.
Humanity fell from its original state with God, and as a result, all creation was subjected to bondage and decay.
Animals, once living in harmony and trust with man, now fear and flee from him.
The dominion of man, designed to reflect God's perfect order, has become broken and distorted, far removed from the perfection of the Garden.

> Hebrews 2:8 \
> Now in putting everything in subjection to him (man), he left nothing outside his (mans) control. \
> At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him (man).

### Man’s state apart from God

Separated from God, humanity is incapable of perfect stewardship.
Apart from Christ, we live under the influence of our "earthly father," the devil.
In our rebellion, we placed ourselves under his dominion, forsaking the Father who is the source of life.
Death entered the world, and corruption followed, bringing pain, suffering, and the brokenness observed daily in today’s world.
Christ sent his Spirit upon His ascension into Heaven.
The Holy Spirit performs many functions one of which applies here;
the Holy Spirit reduces some of the effects of the curse when believers live, walk and trust in the Christ.
He grants believers capacity to reduce the curse by overcoming evil as God sanctifies them and places God's glory on display in a world darkened by rebellion and evil.
However, all flesh will die and must die because of personal evil.

"The soul that sins (commits crimes against a Holy God) shall die".

### The hope of perfect dominion in Christ

Perfect dominion is an ongoing process and will be fully realized in the kingdom of Christ when He establishes the new heavens and the new earth. As the King of kings and the perfect Adam, all things will be placed under His dominion. His rule will restore what was lost, bringing perfect order, peace, and righteousness.

### The completion of the dominion mandate

In Christ, the dominion mandate will reach its glorious completion. Animals will live in harmony with humanity once more. There will be no more war, sorrow, suffering, death, or disease. The curse will be lifted, and creation will be fully redeemed. The peace and perfection of God’s original design will be restored, and His people will dwell with Him forever in unbroken fellowship.

### Present Fulfillment

Quoted from _EoBP J. Barton Payne_,
"Adam's potential of dominion anticipates Christ's victory at His ascension into his Kingdom to the right hand of the Father.

A kingdom in which the dominion mandate is being and will be fulfilled in us through Him as His brothers and sisters made Holy.

> Hebrews 2:9 \
> 9 But we see him who for a little while **was made lower than the angels**, namely Jesus, \
> crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, \
> so that by the grace of God **he might taste death for everyone**. \
> \
> 10 For it was fitting that **he, for whom and by whom all things exist**, \
> in bringing many sons to glory, should make **the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering**. \
> \
> 11 For **he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source**. \
> That is why **he is not ashamed to call them brothers**, \
> \
> 12 saying, \
> \
    “I will tell of your name to my brothers; \
     in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.” \
\
13 And again, \
\
 “I will put my trust in him.” \
\
And again, \
 “Behold, I and the children God has given me.”
