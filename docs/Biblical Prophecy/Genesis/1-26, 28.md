# Genesis 1:26, 28 Dominion



![Lion and Lamb](./lion-lamb.png)


> Genesis 1:26, 28 \
> Let man have dominion... over all the Earth


## Fulfilled in Part, Yet Not Perfect
The dominion mandate was fulfilled in part, but not perfectly, due to the sinfulness of man. Humanity fell from its original state with God, and as a result, all creation was subjected to bondage and decay. Animals, once living in harmony and trust with man, now fear and flee from him. The dominion of man, designed to reflect God's perfect order, has become broken and distorted, far removed from the perfection of the Garden.

### Man’s State Apart from God
Separated from God, humanity is incapable of perfect stewardship without the empowering presence of His Spirit. Apart from Christ, we live under the influence of our "earthly father," the devil. In our rebellion, we placed ourselves under his dominion, forsaking the Father who is the source of life. Death entered the world, and corruption followed, bringing pain, suffering, and the brokenness evident in today’s world.

### The Hope of Perfect Dominion in Christ
Perfect dominion is an ongoing process and will be fully realized in the kingdom of Christ when He establishes the new heavens and the new earth. As the King of kings and the perfect Adam, all things will be placed under His dominion. His rule will restore what was lost, bringing perfect order, peace, and righteousness.

### The Completion of the Dominion Mandate
In Christ, the dominion mandate will reach its glorious completion. Animals will live in harmony with humanity once more. There will be no more war, sorrow, suffering, death, or disease. The curse will be lifted, and creation will be fully redeemed. The peace and perfection of God’s original design will be restored, and His people will dwell with Him forever in unbroken fellowship.
