## Genesis
Genesis 2:9; 3:22, 24 

> Gen 2:9 \
9 And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. \
**The tree of life was in the midst of the garden**

> Gen 3:22 \
22 Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. \
Now, **lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—**”

> Gen 3:24 \
24 He drove out the man, and **at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life**. 

- The tree is a symbol of life. 
- It signifies living forever. 
- It stood in the center of the garden.
- If man had not fallen he would have continued living in the garden and fulfilled the dominion mandate. 


[JBP] "The tree, moreover, did not lose its power through humanity's fall; it prophesies a life yet to be attained in the future." 

## The Tree of Life as Christ

> John 6:35 \
Jesus said to them, \
'I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.'

> John 14:6 \
"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. \
No one comes to the Father except through me.'"

> John 15:1-5 \
“**I am the true vine**, and my Father is the vinedresser. \
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away,and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. \
Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. \
**Abide in me, and I in you**. \
As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. \
I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, **for apart from me you can do nothing**.

The imagery of **abiding in Christ as the vine** (John 15:1-5) parallels the idea of being sustained by the Tree of Life.



## Revelation

> Rev 2:7 
7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. \
**To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life**, which is in the paradise of God

> Rev 22:14 
14 Blessed are those **who wash their robes**, so that they may have the right to the **tree of life** and that they may enter the city by the gates. 

[JBP] "Provides the straightforward prediction of this same promise. Mankind's life is perfected in the New Jerusalem" (Rev 22:2)
