# Arguments against Christ as Messiah

Answers will be added as future documents, this page is tracking statements made by Jewish Rabbis.

## The Divinity of Jesus and the Trinity

**Objections:**
- Judaism rejects the concept of God taking human form or existing as a trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).
- Belief in a corporeal or finite God contradicts Jewish theology, which holds that God is infinite and non-material.

## The Concept of the Second Coming

**Objections:**
- In Jewish theology, the Messiah must complete his mission (gathering the Jews to Israel, rebuilding the Temple, and establishing world peace) in his lifetime.
- Jesus was crucified and did not fulfill these tasks, leading Christianity to develop the idea of a "Second Coming," which Judaism does not accept.


## The Abrogation of the Torah

**Objections:**
- Christianity, particularly through Paul, introduced the idea of "justification by faith" rather than adherence to the Torahâ€™s commandments.
- Judaism views the Torah as eternal and unchangeable, rejecting the notion that the Sinaitic covenant could be replaced or made obsolete.
