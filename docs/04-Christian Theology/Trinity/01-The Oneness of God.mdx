## Claim: The Oneness of God, Monotheism

Christianity affirms monotheism: there is only one God.

## üìú Key Scriptures

> Deuteronomy 6:4 (ESV)  
> 4¬†Hear, O Israel:
> The LORD our God, **the LORD is one**.

> Isaiah 43:10-11 (ESV) \
> 10 **You are my witnesses**, declares the LORD,  
> and **my servant whom I have chosen**,  
> that you may know and **believe me**  
> and understand that **I am he**.  
> **Before me no god was formed**,  
> nor shall there be any after me.
>
> 11¬†**I, I am the LORD,  
> and besides me there is no savior**

> Isaiah 45:5 (ESV) \
>  5¬†**I am the LORD**, and there is no other, **besides me there is no God**; \
> 8¬† Fear not, nor be afraid;  
> have I not told you from of old and declared it?  
> And you are my witnesses!  
> **Is there a God besides me**?  
> *There is **no Rock**; I know not any.

_\*In context, there is **no "other" rock**. Scripture affirms that God alone is the rock. See [ü™® God as the Rock](#-god-as-the-rock) below_

> 1 Timothy 2:5 (ESV)  
> 3¬†This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of **God our Savior**,  
> 4¬†who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
> 5¬†For there is **one God**, and there is **one mediator** between God and men, **the man Christ Jesus**,

## üïäÔ∏è Key Insight

The foundation of the Trinity is the oneness of God ‚Äî one in being or essence, not three separate gods.

## ü™® God as the Rock

While the description of "Rock" is used as a **poetic metaphor**, it expresses a deeper **literal reality** about God's nature.  
If God is truly real (which the Scripture affirms), then **He is actually the Rock** of our salvation‚Äînot in a physical, material sense, but in an ultimate, spiritual, and existential sense.
