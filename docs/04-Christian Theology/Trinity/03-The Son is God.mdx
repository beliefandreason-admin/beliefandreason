### Jesus Forgives Sins (Which Only God Can Do)

The Bible teaches that **only God has the authority to forgive sins** (Isaiah 43:25, Mark 2:7). The Jewish leaders understood that claiming to forgive sins was an act of **divine authority**, yet Jesus repeatedly exercised this power, proving His deity. Additionally, **Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22** prophesy the **suffering servant** who would bear the sins of the people, a role only God could fulfill.

#### Old Testament Foundation: God Alone Forgives Sins

| **Reference** | **Verse** |

| **Colossians 3:13** | "As the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." |
| **Matthew 9:6** | "But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins‚Äîhe then said to the paralytic‚Äî'Rise, pick up your bed and go home.'" |

#### The Suffering Servant: Jesus Bears Our Sins (Isaiah 53 & Psalm 22)

The Old Testament prophesied that **God Himself** would provide atonement for sin. Jesus, the **suffering servant**, fulfilled these prophecies by **taking upon Himself the punishment for sin**.

| **Reference** | **Verse** |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Isaiah 53:5** | "But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." |
| **Isaiah 53:6** | "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned‚Äîevery one‚Äîto his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all." |
| **Isaiah 53:12** | "Yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors." |
| **Psalm 22:16-18** | "For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet... They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." |
| **Matthew 26:28** | "For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." |


### Jesus is the Creator

Jesus is not a created being; **He is the Creator**.

| **Genesis 1:26** | "Then God said, ‚ÄòLet us make man in our image, after our likeness.‚Äô" |

### Jesus Calls Himself God

| **John 8:58** | "Before Abraham was, I am." (*See Exodus 3:14*) |
| **John 10:30-33** | "I and the Father are one." |
| **John 14:9** | "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father." |

| **Revelation 22:13** | "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end." |
