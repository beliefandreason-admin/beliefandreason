## **A Scholarly Comparison of the Enuma Elish and the Genesis Creation Account**

## **Introduction**

The study of ancient creation narratives has long been a focal point in theological and historical discourse. In contemporary discussions, figures like Billy Carson and other alternative scholars argue that the **Enuma Elish**, a Babylonian creation myth, serves as evidence that the biblical Genesis account is derived from earlier Mesopotamian traditions. However, such claims often rely on **misinterpretations, selective readings, and a failure to recognize theological and literary distinctions** between these texts.

The purpose of this paper is to **clarify the true nature of the Enuma Elish**, **compare it with the Genesis creation account**, and **refute the notion that Genesis is merely a retelling of earlier myths**. By examining the historical, literary, and theological frameworks of both texts, this analysis aims to provide a clearer understanding of their fundamental differences.

## **Historical Context of the Enuma Elish**

The **Enuma Elish** is an ancient Mesopotamian creation myth that provides insight into Babylonian cosmology and religious beliefs. Discovered in the 19th century, it remains one of the most significant texts in understanding Near Eastern mythology.

### **Discovery and Preservation**
- The text was excavated in the **Library of Ashurbanipal** (7th century BCE) in **Nineveh**, the ancient Assyrian capital (modern-day Iraq).
- It was discovered by **British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard** in the mid-19th century.
- Fragments of the text are housed primarily in the **British Museum**, with some pieces located in Iraq and other institutions worldwide.

### **Composition and Language**
- The Enuma Elish is inscribed on **seven clay tablets** in **cuneiform script**.
- It is written in **Akkadian**, the language of the Babylonians.
- While the tablets date to approximately the **12th century BCE**, the story likely originates from an **older oral tradition dating back to the 18th century BCE or earlier**.

### **Summary of the Enuma Elish**
The narrative describes the **cosmic battle between gods**, culminating in the ascendancy of **Marduk**, the chief deity of Babylon. 
- **Tiamat**, a primordial goddess of chaos, is slain by Marduk.
- From Tiamat’s body, Marduk **fashions the heavens and the earth**.
- Humanity is created from the **blood of Kingu**, another defeated deity, to serve the gods.
- The text reflects a **polytheistic worldview**, emphasizing **divine conflict, power struggles, and cosmic disorder**.

#### **Key Themes in the Enuma Elish:**
- **The universe emerges from violence** and divine conflict.
- **Multiple gods** engage in a struggle for supremacy.
- **Humans are created as slaves** to perform menial labor for the gods.
- **The gods are fallible**, jealous, and power-hungry.

## **The Genesis Creation Account: A Theological Contrast**

The **Genesis creation account (Genesis 1-2)** presents a **monotheistic** perspective, in stark contrast to the polytheistic and chaotic themes of the Enuma Elish.

### **Key Themes in Genesis**
- **One sovereign God** creates the universe by His divine word.
- **Creation is orderly, peaceful, and good**, not born from conflict.
- **Humans are created in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-27)**, endowed with dignity and purpose.
- **God desires a relationship with humanity**, rather than subjugating them to servitude.
- The **Sabbath is instituted as a day of rest**, contrasting the perpetual labor imposed by Mesopotamian myths.

|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Origin of Creation**               | Creation emerges from a battle between gods.                                        | God creates the universe by His spoken word, without conflict.                               |
| **Nature of the Creator**            | Multiple gods; Marduk attains supremacy through battle.                             | One sovereign God (Yahweh) who exists eternally.                                             |

## **Possible Connection to the Tower of Babel Event**

It is plausible that the **Enuma Elish** and other ancient creation myths trace back to a **common ancestral narrative**, possibly linked to the time of the **Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9)** when God **confused human languages** and scattered people across the earth.

### **Divine Council and the Division of the Nations**
Biblical passages such as **Deuteronomy 32:8-9** indicate that God **divided the nations** and assigned them to the **“Sons of God” (bene Elohim)**, spiritual beings who later became corrupt. However, **God reserved Jacob as His own portion**, showing His sovereign choice of Israel as the people through whom His covenant would be fulfilled.

This concept is reinforced in:
- **Psalm 82** – which speaks of a divine council and the judgment of rebellious gods (elohim).
- **Psalm 89** – which describes the divine assembly of heavenly beings.
- **Paul’s writings** – which refer to these fallen beings as **spiritual powers in high places** (Ephesians 6:12).
- **Job 15:15** – which states that even the heavens and His holy ones are not pure in His sight, suggesting that these spiritual beings are accountable to God and subject to judgment.

These **fallen spiritual authorities** may have influenced **pagan mythologies**, leading different cultures to deify these beings and integrate them into their religious systems. The **Enuma Elish**, with its pantheon of warring deities, could reflect a **corrupted version** of the original divine order established by God before the fall of these beings.
